				<h2>Troy Kirk</h2>
				<p>Student Number: s3996531</p>
				<p>Troy is Australian born, of American and British descent. A qualified Paramedic, Troy is interested in travelling, gaming, running, snowboarding and watching sport. Troy lives with Erica his wife, Blake his 10-year-old son and a 40kg mutt named Bernie. Bernie has travelled around the world with Troy and because of immigration fees might be the world's most expensive mutt. Troy's early interest in IT blossomed when he got a Sega Mega Drive for Christmas. Educational requirements led to Troy's first PC. Troy spent 10 years in the US before returning to Australia in 2021. The flexibility and remote working capabilities of the IT industry particularly appeal to Troy who has recently returned to the US.</p>

				<h2>Andrew Jovanovic</h2>
				<p>Student Number: s3992800</p>
				<p>Andrew is a mechanic from Melbourne. He is passionate about travelling, family and friends, good food, football and of course, lots of video games! Andrew's interest in IT first came in the form of gaming consoles and became an obsession when he got his first PC. This quickly led to him building his own PC. It was a lot of fun learning about what each piece of hardware did and physically putting the computer together felt like assembling a spaceship, the first boot was always so satisfying. From that moment Andrew knew he would like to pursue a career in IT. Andrew experimented with a short course in website coding which affirmed his interest. Andrew is a lifelong learner and looks forward to expanding his IT skills set.</p>

				<h2>Fawaz Jeneby</h2>
				<p>Student Number: s3992254</p>
                <p>Fawaz is a first year uni student. He was born in Australia and is of Asian and African ethnicity. The eldest of six children and one of twins, Fawaz was homeschooled through high school. In between looking after his younger sibs and uni, Fawaz enjoys maths, music (he sings and plays the piano) and mobile gaming. Fawaz became interested in IT at age 14 when he was doing an online career test and trying to see what job suits him. The first fifteen answers were all IT-related and the salary prospect was high so Fawaz decided to utilise Khan Academy to make a start on learning programming. Fawaz's mathematical background led to his interest in data analytics. Fawaz hopes to obtain a strong IT foundation through his university studies.</p>

            <h1>Psychometric Profiles</h1>

			<span class="teammember">
				<h2>Troy</h2>
				<p>Myers-Briggs Test:  Advocate, 55% Introverted, 52% Intuitive, 57% Feeling, 65% Judging, 85% Assertive.</p>
				<p>Learning Styles Quiz: 25.8% Reflector, 34.4% Theorist, 34.4% Pragmatist, 5.5% Activist.</p>
				<p>Big Five Personality Test: 22% Extroversion, 11% Emotional stability, 35% Agreeableness, 15% Conscientiousness, 34% Intellect / Imagination.</p>
				<p>The result explained to me that I am a good team member. I can take lead of the team if needed and I can sit back and let someone else be the focus of the group. Saying this, I always like to help others and make sure I am doing everything I can to complete a goal. I do like to sit back and identify other personality types and how I can adjust my behavior to best mesh with them. When it comes to being part of a team, I am more than happy to play whatever role needs to be done whether that be a leader at the top to direct others or a foot soldier at the bottom taking orders and getting the work done.</p>
			</span>
			<span class="teammember">
				<h2>Andrew</h2>
				<p>Myers-Briggs Test:  Virtuoso, 76% Introverted, 52% Observant, 54% Thinking, 58% Prospecting, 64% Turbulent.</p>
				<p>Learning Styles Quiz: 40% Auditory, 30% Visual, 30% Tactile.</p>
				<p>Big Five Personality Test: 22% Extroversion, 11% Emotional stability, 35% Agreeableness, 15% Conscientiousness, 34% Intellect / Imagination.</p>
				<p>As an introverted personality, listening to others makes me feel comfortable in group settings. I typically let others talk first before thinking about my response and adding my feedback or opinion. I do feel that I am more introverted with certain types of communication, I often prefer to text than call, type than meet. This will definitely be a learning curve and something to overcome, but extremely beneficial for future projects and careers. Lastly, as my test results reflect, I like to think, a lot. I think this can be useful to my group as I could potentially add in different perspectives to an idea. The downside however is that thinking can turn into dwelling and spending to much time on a particular area to try achieving the perfect result. </p>
			</span>
			<span class="teammember">
				<h2>Sasha</h2>
				<p>Myers-Briggs Test:  Advocate, 96% Introverted, 76% Intuitive, 54% Feeling, 53% Judging, 63% Assertive.</p>
				<p>Learning Styles Quiz: 32% Reflector, 30% Theorist, 32% Pragmatist, 6% Activist.</p>
				<p>Big Five Personality Test: 16% Extroversion, 62% Emotional stability, 11% Agreeableness, 57% Conscientiousness, 96% Intellect / Imagination.</p>
				<p>In a team environment I need to take active care to engage with other team members and not allow myself to fade into the background as more extroverted people take the fore. I need to be conscious of ensuring I treat other team members with respect at all times, even when they are still coming to an understanding that I have already processed. I need to remember that while feeling frustration is perfectly acceptable, it is important to weigh that frustration before expressing it and determine if the cause of the frustration will actually impede the project or if it is just annoying me personally. Lastly, I need to remember that other people process information differently to me and that that is okay.</p>
			</span>
			<span class="teammember">
				<h2>Fawaz</h2>
				<p>Myers-Briggs Test:  Entertainer, 57% Extroverted, 57% Observant, 57% Feeling, 68% Prospecting, 65% Assertive.</p>
				<p>Learning Styles: Education Planner concluded that I am an Auditory/tactile learner.</p>
				<p>DISC Personality Test: 33% Compliance, 25% Steadiness, 23% Dominance, 19% Influence.</p>
				<p>According to the test results, I am a team member that can adjust to anything and give new ideas. I am also a team member that will just observe what’s happening in the group and can help with any mistakes in the group.  I need to sometimes get in and talk about ideas if necessary rather than just stepping back all the time and I also need to learn how to control myself when someone criticises me on my work and understand that they are trying to help me rather than hurt me and I need to keep focused and follow the schedule the team gave me and be organised.</p>
			</span>
			<span class="teammember">
				<h2>Chris</h2>
				<p>Myers-Briggs Test:  Protagonist, 79% Extroverted, 62% Intuitive, 60% Feeling, 53% Judging, 82% Turbulent.</p>
				<p>Learning Styles Quiz: 0.167 Reflector, 0.237 Theorist, 0.237 Pragmatist, 0.237 Activist.</p>
				<p>Big Five Personality Test: 96% Extroversion, 62% Emotional stability, 35% Agreeableness, 87% Conscientiousness, 28% Intellect / Imagination.<br/>
				Very extroverted, friendly and optimistic</p>
				<p>My test results put me as a very helpful and motivating leader. I believe this with reflect well with my team by helping the shy people be more involved. I am very task orientated and like to stick to a list and the passion that my turbulent behaviour can help with that drive.</p>
			</span>
			<span class="fullgroup">
				<p>After forming our group and reviewing everyone's profiles, it was good to see that we had a good mix of personalities. There seems to be a healthy balance of introverted and extroverted personas which can be ideal for communicating. The diversity of our group is a significant asset and in practice we have supported each other well. </p>
			</span>

            <h1>Ideal Jobs</h1>
				<p>Each member of our group sees a different ideal job on their horizons. Troy and Andrew both want to be developers, Front End for Troy and Full Stack for Andrew. Sasha intends on becoming a Data Architect, Fawaz aspires to be a Quants Engineer, and, Chris wants to be a Penetration Tester.</p>
                <h2>What common elements are there?</h2>
				<p>Programming languages like Python, Java and JavaScript were the most common skills required across all of the job roles. In some cases, full stack developers required good knowledge of all three languages whereas the other roles required a high level of proficiency in either one or two languages. Surprisingly, 80% of our group also required experience in database management systems. This could include systems like SQL or NoSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. This indicated that regardless of the role, it was essential to have knowledge of popular languages and database systems. These requirements may not just be for working within your own role, but more importantly be able to communicate and collaborate with others.</p>
				<h2>What differentiates each position?</h2>
				<p>Specificity is what differentiates each role. Although almost each role required knowledge of popular, common programming languages, specificity is what differentiates each role. Roles like Penetration Testing, Data Analyst and Database Architects needed more specific languages and DBMS experience as their positions focused more on backend structures and development. Front-End and Full Stack Developers required more specificity in HTML and CSS systems in order to style and interpret websites, applications, and programs to users.</p>
				<h2>How similar or different are your career plans across the group?</h2>
				<p>Again, each role shares the similarity of using a particular language, but this is mainly due to their popularity and effectiveness. Each role is vastly different from the next as they work within their own focus areas. Some roles use data, networks, and frameworks whereas others shift more towards aesthetics, functionality, and creativity.</p>

			<p>The Git repository audit trail provides a fairly accurate summary of the work performed by our group members over the duration of this assignment. While it fails to track progress on individual components while we were getting them to the draft stages, from that point forwards all our activities have left their marks on the audit trail. We could have gotten better value out of the audit trail if we had placed our changes comments in the comment title rather than the additional comments, as looking through the resultant audit trail you have to click on the ellipsis link on each commit to see the noted detail of the commit while "Add files via upload" is shown up front with no extra clicking.</p>

            <h1>Industry Data</h1>
			<h2>Employer Desirability</h2>
			<p>The group listed Full Stack Developer, Quants Engineer, Front End Developer, Penetration Tester and Database Architect as our ideal jobs.</p> 
			<p>The table below shows how our chosen roles rank within the scope of the Burning Glass Top Job Titles March 2017 – Feb 18 dataset. I have cast the
			Quants Engineer role as IT Business Analyst and the Penetration Tester as Security Consultant in order to obtain their closest matches within the dataset.</p>
			<table><tr><th>Job</th><th>Ranking</th><th>Total % of Job Listings</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Front End Developer</td><td>6<sup>th</sup></td><td>0.61%</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Full Stack Developer</td><td>17<sup>th</sup></td><td>0.29%</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Data Architect</td><td>47<sup>th</sup></td><td>0.14%</td></tr>
			<tr><td>IT Business Analyst</td><td>63<sup>rd</sup></td><td>0.10%</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Security Consultant</td><td>80<sup>th</sup></td><td>0.09%</td></tr></table>
			<p>It is worthy of note that the Job Title dataset has not been manipulated and these numbers under-represent some of the jobs.  Full Stack developer sees additional categories further down the list with Full Stack Java Dev ranked 70th, Full Stack .Net dev ranked 72nd and Senior Full Stack dev ranked 90th. Rolling these additional Full Stack roles into the one grouping would see Full Stack Development rise to the 10th Rank. Including Front End Web Developer & Frontend Developer with Front End Developer would bring this role up to 2nd Rank after Solutions Architect. Similar observations could be made about the other roles on our list.</p>
			<p>Moving to the Burning Glass Top Occupations data  for the same period we see more consolidated data. In first place, with 24.15% of all job listings by occupation, is Software development / engineering. Cyber Security comes in at 13th with 2.39% of listings and Data Architect at 18th with 1.24%. Database Administration is in the 12th rank and could reasonably be compiled with Data Architect producing an effective rank of 8th in the listings. Quants Engineering's closest match in the data would be Business Intelligence Dev in 21st rank.</p> 
			<h2>Key Skills</h2>
			<h3>IT Required Skill Set</h3>
			<p>There was significant overlap in required IT skills across our preferred roles. The most common required skills included:</p>
			<ul><li>JavaScript,</li>
				<li>Java,</li>
				<li>SQL,</li>
				<li>CSS & HTML5,</li>
				<li>.NET</li>
				<li>AWS or Azure</li>
				<li>RESTful API's</li>
				<li>React framework</li>
				<li>UI Frameworks</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other programming languages such as Perl, C++, C# and Python also occurred in our required skills along with general IT skills such as an understanding of mobile computing or web optimisation.</p>
			<h3>General Required Skill Set</h3>
			<p>Our specific job advertisements specified a minimal set of general required skills, notably:</p>
			<ul><li>Technical Report Writing,</li>
				<li>Teamwork,</li>
				<li>lifelong learning philosophy,</li>
				<li>Leadership, and,</li>
				<li>Communication skills.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While required general skills are somewhat harder to identify on a role by role basis, there are many academic papers pointing towards the great significance of general skills in relation to employability within the ICT sector.</p>
			<p>Anicic and Buselic identified rapid knowledge acquisition to be the most sought after generic skill by employers followed by the capacity to identify and resolve problems, to apply knowledge in practical situations, to work in a team, to think analytically, personal responsibility, adaptability, creativity, ability to work under pressure and ability to work independently. (Anicic and Buselic 2021)</p>
			<p>Robles identifies integrity, communication, courtesy, responsibility, social skills, positive attitude, professionalism, flexibility, teamwork, and work ethic as the top 10 'soft' skills sought after by executives in new employees. (Roubles 2012)</p>
			<p>Stevens points towards communication skills with an emphasis on verbal communication and public speaking.  (Stevens 2005)</p>
			<h3>Specific skills requirements of employers.</h3>
			<p>The most in demand IT skill according to the Burning Glass data is SQL. From the top 15, SQL, JavaScript, Java, C#, .NET, Git, Python and HTML all fall into our required skill set (8 of 15). The lowest ranked of the IT skills on our required skills list is C#, ranked 172nd </p>
			<p>In the general skills category, Communication skills take the top rank, included in 36.4% of job listings, followed by problem solving (13.5%), organisational skills (13%), writing (12.8%), collaboration (11.8%), troubleshooting (9.4%) and planning (9.3%) in descending order. All of these skills featured prominently in the articles considered above. Contrary to Anicic and Buselic's findings, being a quick learner is ranked 27th in the burning glass data, appearing in only 1.42% of job listings. </p>
			<p>All the members of our group are interested in programming based roles however, according to the Burning Glass Data other technical skills are also highly sought after. The three highest ranked technical skills that do not occur in our required skills set are Microsoft Windows, SAP and Graphic Design.</p>
			<p>Conversely the general skills list sees comprehensive coverage. There are no highly ranked general skills that do not fall into the scope of our required skill set as expanded by the academic contributions. </p>
			<p>While none of us are inclined to realign their intent for an ideal job, we were all struck by the weight of emphasis placed on 'soft' skills in relation to employability. In the course of this research it has become clear that while technical skills may get you the interview, it is your soft skills that will get you the job over your competitors, no matter what specific role you are aiming for.  </p>

            <h1>IT Work In Real Life</h1>
			<h2>Steven Crawford - Technology Teacher (K-8) and IT Admin</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p><a href="https://rmiteduau-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/s3996531_student_rmit_edu_au/EUjF8Us8PFxLsoDJKn3Ow9ABmEkJPKwDR7XiL9Acsf5XCQ" target="_blank">Interview Recording</a> | 
			<a href="https://andrewjovanovic.github.io/AssignmentTwo/transcript.txt" target="_blank">Plain Text Transcript</a></p>
			<h2>What kind of work does Steven do?</h2>
			<p>Steven is responsible for his schools entire IT department. Steven deals with everthing IT related at his school, from major infrastructure works right down to end-user support and enjoys the comprehensive perspective that his role requires. Prior to his current job Steven primarily worked in  networking and IT infrastructure within the Healthcare industry and has also worked in Project Management and executive roles including tech director and CIO.</p>
			<p>Steven has been in the education sector for the last 6 years after applying for a network engineer role with the education district and attending the incorrect interview. The teaching  aspect of Steven's work involves teaching children K - 8 how to use computers, from basic typing right up to coding HTML and Python. Steven finds the spark of realisation on his students faces to be the most satisfying aspect of his current work.</p>
			
			<h2>What kinds of people does Steven interact with?</h2>
			<p>Within his teaching role Steven mainly interacts with the school's interested parties, the Teachers and students, school administrators and of course the parents. In prior roles Steven had to regularly deal with IT subcontractors in order to complete infrastructure tasks with minimal downtime in a 24/7/365 environment, but, within his current role it is possible to do infrastructure works during routine downtime, such as school holidays. As a result Steven rarely needs to deal with subcontractors in his current role, largely performing the works himself. </p>
			<p>Steven also interacts with IT representitive from his local County as his school shares some resources such as e-mail servers with the County.</p>
			
			<h2>Where does Steven spend most of their work time?</h2>
			<p>During the school year Steven spends most of his time in the classroom running lessons and around the school providing end-user support. Outside of the teaching year, Steven spends most of his time working in the network infrastructure and similar tasks that compel downtime for the IT system. As a result these times of year see Steven spending much more time in his Server complex and in ceilings and crawlspaces.</p>
			
			<h2>What aspect of Steven's position is most challenging?</h2>
			<p>When Steven started in healthcare the level of industry best practice was much lower than you would expect in IT today and Steven was able to follow the increaing complexities of modern IT as they were introduced. Steven feels that today's IT industry is much more specialised and in the modern era it would be almost impossible to tackle the breadth of aspects of IT that he dealt with routinely in his early career. Towards the end of Steven's time in the Healthcare sector, the rate of change in IT best practice and regulatory frameworks went in to overdrive and became overwhelming. He also found that the level to which individual employees could be held responsible for regulatory issues greatly increased the stress of the role.</p>
			<p>In Steven's current role the greatest challenge is managing the diversity of his role, balancing the needs of students, end-user support and infrastructure works.</p>
			
			<h2>How has the qualification framework for IT Professionals changed through the course of Steven's career?</h2>
			<p>Steven started working in the IT industry in 1988 and in that era verifications were all the rage. The naughties saw the growth of industry certifications and employers were looking for specific company based qualifications like the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) or Certified Novell Administrator (CNA) qualifications as well as somewhat more general qualifications such as those issued by Comptia. In the modern era the university degree has come into its own and while industry certifications still carry significant weight they no longer stand alone and are best accompanied by a relevant degree.</p>
			<p>While it isn't a certification Steven thinks very highly of having a home computer lab of some kind to enable experimentation if you intend on working in the network infrastructure realm.</p>

				<h2>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</h2>
				<h3>Blockchain</h3>
				<p>Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and often public digital ledger. It is used to keep records of transactions between networks or peer to peer environments. The primary use of Blockchain technology is as a distributed ledger for Cryptocurrencies. For every transaction using Blockchain Technology, a record or a block is formed. These blocks are linked or chained together providing both parties with a full, audited and unalterable transaction history. This gives the end buyer the full history and information from the first transaction in the chain which may have occured many owners ago. Transparency and the distributed nature of the ledgers of transactions result in it being very hard and time consuming to hack or disrupt a Blockchain. If you have 10 transactions in a Blockchain and 1 gets altered to change the details of the transaction, the block validation algorithms will see that 1 block has different details compared to the other 9, it will then change that 1 block to copy the greater consensus. Whereas if 6 out of the 10 blocks have the same information and 4 are different then the 4 will be changed to mimic the other 6. Basically if someone wants to alter a blockchain for malicious purposes they would need to change at least 51% of the blocks in the chain to gain the majority before the algorithm would propagate the hack. This process would be very time consuming and costly as each transaction is also date and time stamped to help combat this.</p>
				<p>There are 3 common types of Blockchain:</p>
				<p><ol><li>Permissioned or private Blockchain.</li>
				<li>Permissionless or public Blockchain.</li>
				<li>Hybrid or consortium Blockchain.</li></ol></p>
				<p>The permissioned or private Blockchain is a small scale version of the public one. Generally used in a business for Supply chain management, asset ownership or internal voting. Private Blockchain transactions are faster due to the smaller number of nodes that need to be verified during a transaction. Fewer nodes on a Blockchain also increase the security risk. The reduced number of nodes means it can be more easily altered. Typically a private Blockchain will require each node to be approved before joining the Blockchain.</p>
				<p>Public Blockchain is, as the name would suggest, open to anyone that wishes to join the network and establish a node. It is decentralized meaning no single organization controls the Blockchain. Public Blockchains being open nature, they should be secured with cryptography and a proof of work consensus system. Generally used for Cryptocurrencies, a new block cannot be added to the chain without the node or transaction being confirmed with the consensus system, making forging transactions near impossible.</p>
				<p>Thirdly we have a Hybrid Blockchain which is a mix of both public and private. The architecture of this Blockchain is entirely customizable and members who use this can decide on which transactions are available to everyone or who can access the Blockchain. Being controlled by a smaller peer group this can pose some risks of dishonest people but with the immutability and security that each transaction has it is still very hard to alter or manipulate.</p>
				<h3>Cryptocurrency</h3>
				<p>Cryptocurrency is a digital currency which can be used as a form of payment instead of traditional state-backed currencies such as the Euro or the British Pound. Cryptocurrency is created using encryption algorithms and use the Blockchain technology. Your digital wallet, stores your crypto coins and acts as a virtual account system in addition to tracking your cryptocurrency balances.</p>
				<p>Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to receive widespread attention but subsequently the crypto market has branched into thousands of other different coins with varying implementations.</p>
				<h3>The future of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h3>
				<p>The next couple of years will be interesting regarding what is next for Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency. Smart contracts will come into play with conditions that can be self-executed and self-enforcing. Supply chain uses are also a step forward for the Blockchain technology with each step of the way from say the farm to consumer being recorded and tracked via the Blockchain. This will keep everyone accountable on damages or health violations that can arise and create true producer/maufacturer to consumer data trails. </p>
				<p>Blockchain Technology can impact various aspects of our lives from Finance and banking to online security as well as supply chain management. The banking sector are working on adapting Blockchain Technology to allow the exchanging of money to become more efficient, secure and faster. Some say the future of Blockchain technology can replace the bank ideology all together. Without any need for a centralized governing entity what would we need them for? One example relates to humanitarian workers in the middle of war torn African countries, many of whom have no access to banks and need to be paid in cash. NGO's and other agencies then need to hike through remote jungles with bags full of cash to pay their workers at the risk of theft, kidnapping or death. With Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies these issues can be alleviated or even completely overcome. </p>
				<p>Cybersecurity could benefit as well with having a decentralized system rather than a centralized server with data loss, corruption and human error all factors that can be wiped out with the Blockchain technology. Instead of a hacker needing to infiltrate one system or server they would need to hit 51% of the Blockchain system at the exact time to cause any disruption. The healthcare sector could see passing of information quicker and more securely from GP's to hospitals and specialists and Government voting could be submitted in real time via the Blockchain system with more security and efficiency than present systems supply.</p>
				<p>Blockchain technologies offer boundless potential to revolutionise the way we do business. Blockchain is a true disruptor and it's transformative nature is sure to impact on industry in many and unanticipated ways. Blockchain technologies have the potential to completely change the way the world deals with things like banking and trade, and could foreseeably result in traditional finace going the way of the dodo.</p>
				<h3>The Impact of Blockchain Technologies on Daily Life</h3>
				<p>It seems difficult to overestimate the probable impact of Blockchain technologies on our daily lives. Social media platforms will be more secure and safe from theft with Blockchain based security greatly increasing the difficulty of hacking these systems. You will have the right to voice your opinion without the risk of retaliation from the centralized company's views or ideologies. Your data is owned and published by you and not something for the company to sell off to the highest bidder. </p>
				<p>Safety and security will be a big part with the future of Blockchain, people will be at ease more knowing their usernames and passwords are stored on encrypted Blockchain networks rather than one server that houses hundreds of millions of others usernames and passwords making it the target for would be thieves. </p>
				<p>The main differences Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies will bring is peace of mind and trust in the system rather than an entity like a bank or the government. Crypto currency will become more and more prevalent as people will want to shy away from government regulations. Crypto, being decentralized, is not subject to national interest and fiscal policy making it a more stable form of value rather than traditional currency.</p>

				<h2>Natural Language Processing and Chatterbots.</h2>

				<h3>What does it do?</h3>
				<p><strong>Natural language Processing</strong></p>
				<p>The term Natural Language Processing or NLP is a broad definition used to describe the translation of languages. In the IT industry, natural language processing refers to a computer science that is used to examine human language and speech that can be converted into computing languages. This converted language can then be used to assist and further develop areas of artificial intelligence (AI), management and distribution of complex data, online monitoring, and filtration systems.</p>
				<p>There are five key types of analysis used to handle and process languages:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Tokenization analysis</li>
					<li>Lexical analysis</li>
					<li>Syntactic analysis</li>
					<li>Semantic analysis</li>
					<li>Pragmatic analysis</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Tokenization and Lexical analysis are used to collect language and convert them into characters into a sequence of lexical tokens ('What is Tokenization in NLP – Lexalytics' 2021), these tokens are used to teach machines about words and provide a foundation to work on ('What is Tokenization in NLP – Lexalytics' 2021).</p>
				<p>Syntactic analysis operates on understanding the logical composition of a sentence or text ('Syntactic analysis' n.d.) whereas semantic analysis uses interpretation to process sentences and pull meaning from sentences and texts ('Semantic Analysis, Explained' 2020). Both forms of analysis rely heavily on the use of correct grammar to be effective. </p>
				<p>Finally, pragmatic analysis relies on external word knowledge to interpret a sentence's meaning and reiterate typically in a more complete, condensed form of communication ('Pragmatic Analysis | Python Natural language Processing' n.d.).</p>
				<p>Each method of analysis can be crucial depending how they are implemented and what type of processing they will be handling. As an example, tokenization and lexical analysis could be used as tools to build a foundation of keywords to target in search engines or translation software whereas syntactic, semantic and pragmatic may be utilized in chat bots that provide assistance and guidance.</p>
				<p><strong>Chatterbots</strong></p>
				<p>Chatbots or chatterbots are software that run in the form of an application used online to service communication and interaction. These applications work by processing, analysing and translating voice or text and generating a response based on the users' requests. Chatterbots can be thought as an extension of natural language processing, where NLP provides the framework to translate the information, chatterbots are the application used to implement it online.</p>
				<p>Currently, chatterbots are used to navigate conversation and handle low complexity tasks. The most common type of chatbots are assistance-based applications, which are typically the first point of contact for users that offer guidance and help with common pain points. The technology now allows chatbots to handle the initial contact as they typically offer up pre-generated conversation that users can interact with. This is where the software relies on the use of keywords in order to continue or navigate the conversation. As the interaction takes on more complexity, for example, where users are now asking questions or responding with sentences, the application is relying on analysing the logic and understanding of text or voice to continue the interaction. Most chatbots now are simply used as a tool to start a conversation, find a user's paint point and connect them with a person. This is simply because the technology isn't available for chatterbots to be able to handle the complexity of a conversation, yet. This is still generally reserved for humans who can process this information quicker, more effectivity and most importantly improvised.</p>
				<p>AI and NLP will be the biggest contributing factors in seeing how chatterbots will develop. As these types of analysis and database tools continue to improve, chatterbot applications will also be able to improve. Chatterbots have proven to be critical tools used by businesses that focus heavily on customer service and experience, so investment will no doubt be possible in making these tools more effective. In future developments, chatterbots may be able to handle more complex styles of interaction or entire conversations. I can see the development of chatterbots taking a similar pathway to how voice recognition software in smart phone and home devices has. The overall product can handle more complex processes but is still quite clunky compared to the control of a human.</p>
				
				<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>

				<p>Natural language processing and chatterbot applications will only continue to improve as technology continues to advance. One area that I can see drastically changing is the complexity and depth chatterbot communication will be able to provide to consumers. Chatterbots now, can only carry out certain aspects of customer service and interaction. Typically, they will guide a user towards the assistance or action they require before the task is passed on to a human that can handle the more challenging level of interaction. Further development of analysis tools in the future could see a depth of AI processing that let's chatterbot applications manage an entire complex interaction independently. A chatterbot that could manage all aspects of a conversation, from answering numerous questions, providing product or technical information, and most importantly, handle complaints, could put immense pressure on the role of support staff. The current job has already seen a reduction in roles and responsibilities as chatterbots usually manage the initial interaction. As AI processing continues to develop, chatterbots could provide personal 24/7 assistance, end to end communication, at a fraction of the cost. This will make it increasingly difficult for business trying to compete with AI, having to choose between having a real person behind a computer or minimising costs and maximising profits. AI software won't require a salary which will lead to a reduction or redundancy of the human support role.</p>
				
				<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>

				<p>I imagine this could have a massive impact on the way we communicate and interact in an online space, which will almost certainly expand into other areas like telephone calls, voice to text, and smart home appliances. I believe it would be a positive experience to have better NLP, chatterbot and AI processing systems integrated into high use, everyday items and provide better overall customer service and convenience. </p>
				<p>Overall, dealing with businesses in an online space and on a telephone would be vastly different if there were chatterbot or voice recognition software in place that could manage an entire conversation. Personally, when I do have an issue online, I use chatbots for assistance which can be frustrating as they can only narrow down a topic I need to discuss with a real person, or they require my details so that someone can make contact later to discuss the issue. It would be extremely beneficial to be able to resolve an issue when it arises. </p>
				<p>Furthermore, I can also see voice to text functions being vastly different as well. The function is a handy tool to have especially for searching long terms on google or replying to messages. However, these functions currently can be quite clunky and often misinterpret words and sentences incorrectly. With advanced software and analysis tools increasing the richness of AI databases, this could mean that human voice is understood much better. This would ultimately reduce how much I would have to check grammatical or interpretation errors and make the software more fluid and seamless. </p>
				<p>I can see family and friends sharing a similar positive experience as well. The biggest issue I hear from older members of family is how frustrating it is to not be able to speak to a real person. If chatbots and AI processing can advance to the point where it is able to replicate a conversation with the same personality as real individual, I can see their experiences being enriched as well.</p>

				<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
				<p>Cybersecurity is the process of protecting computer systems, networks, devices and programs from all sorts of cyber-attacks (Tunggal 2022). Recently the Australian media has made cyber security the center of everyone's attention. With recent cyber-attacks on Optus and Medibank private it has exposed the increasingly sophisticated and always evolving danger to hackers accessing and exposing our data. Attackers are always evolving new methods that are generally powered by social engineering and artificial intelligence compared to the once seen traditional data breach we were used to. As our world becomes increasingly reliant on technology as a regular part of life so do we see the development of new security programs such as cloud security solutions, multi-factor authentication and unauthorized access protocols to stay ahead of malware (Tunggal 2022). Risk of cyber-attacks is forever increasing with our ever-growing global connectivity and use of cloud storage devices. As the development of this technology is becoming complicated, as are the cyber thieves with the creation of new malware and cyber threats. </p>

				<p>It is now common for most workplace to include cyber security training as part of a new employee's introduction period. Staff need to be educated about common cyber threats like social engineering scams, phishing, ransomware and other malware programs designed to steal intellectual property and personal data (Tunggal 2022). Cybersecurity can be broken down into four main areas of concentration. These areas are deterrence, detection, prevention and response. Deterrence can use both physical and online strategies to minimize the risk of security breach (Openpath 2022). Deterrence can start as simple as a fence, video surveillance, access gates and authorized only entries to a build. Online deterrence takes the form of passwords, multi factor authorization and captcha technology. Detection may come in the form of physical door alarms, inappropriate computer behavior or uncommon network log in locations. Prevention is seen as a way of slowing down breaches or intrusion. Online this can take the form of multiple layers of access control, data encryption, multi-factor authentication (Openpath 2022). Security breach have become a common part of the cyber world. An appropriate response to this situation is a crucial part of cyber security. Security technology products including building lockdowns, remote access and controls, and the ability to send live video feeds to first responders are all great examples of this component (Openpath 2022).</p>

				<p>Covid 19 defiantly changed the world we live in. Before 2020 work from home was unheard of and work remotely was seen as a dream job. Since the global pandemic gripped the world, it is estimate that over 35 million American now work from home or remotely (WEF 2020). This means the number of networks and devices that link home computing to corporate platforms has grown dramatically. HP reports that global cyber-attacks are on the rise by 238% since the biggening of the pandemic (WEF 2020). Companies are having to manage these risks by increased security via virtual private networks, continuous password updates, multi factor authorization and increased cybersecurity/ IT employment. As cybercriminals are consistently developing new schemes and programs, organizations are having to invest and develop in new innovated technologies to try to stay ahead of the crime. Real-time data monitoring is a way companies are continuously updating systems and data that is used to protect the organization from cyber criminals (WEF 2020).</p>
				<p>Security professionals can then act on data breaches quickly and avoid the risk of loss. With this data collection organizations can track information over long periods which helps to identify and predict behaviors and anomalies that occur. This method is known as trend monitoring (WEF 2020). New and developing technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Quantum computing are starting to be used by attackers. There is growing evidence that AI could start being used as defensive tools against attacks (WEF 2020). AI could be the future of cybersecurity, however will this put millions of cyber security experts out of work? Quantum computing has been a powerful way to solve some classical mathematical problems in the past (WEF 2020).  If used correctly could quantum computing be used to stay steps ahead of the programs created by cyber criminals. </p>

				<p>In 2021 the global cyber security market was valued at approximately USD 139 billion dollars (Fortune business insights 2022). Moving forward the market is only expected to grow exponentially. Estimates are expecting the industry to double over the next 10 years to a value of USD 375 billion dollars (Fortune business insights 2022). Over the last two years the cybersecurity industry as seen dramatic increase in job availability. With the ever-growing demand for security solutions, position in the cyber security industry have risen by 7.7% since the beginning of the global pandemic (Fortune business insights 2022).  There is already a growing global shortage of cybersecurity specialists. The ever-increasing need for technology to be in our daily lives and make everything we do easier has driven companies to take up a larger online presence. The negative effects of this have been the increase of criminal activity regarding fraud, theft and data breaches. Moving forward companies of all sizes will be investing more time and money into safely securing their online assets. This will only add to the position and jobs available in the cyber security industry. With opportunities becoming increasing available a recent report from ISACA's State of Cybersecurity found that 60% of companies were now reporting difficulties retaining cybersecurity professionals (Comptia 2022).</p>

				<p>According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2.1 million Australians or approximately 11 percent of the population have experienced at least one type of personal fraud in the last 2 years. That is 1 in 9 Australians (abs 2022).  How will it affect you? Most likely someone in your direct family has been affected by fraud recently.  Today almost everyone in our society is connected to the internet either by our smartphones, laptops, game systems or smart watches. Whether we are making purchases via online shopping, completing internet banking via an app or simply just storing bank account details, we are all vulnerable to cyberthreats. Cybersecurity is becoming even more important to everyone's daily life as it protects data from theft and damage. All our devices have multitudes of sensitive information including personal identifiable information, protected health information, intellectual property, data, and government information (Tunggal 2022). Without an antivirus protection service in place our devices cannot defend themselves against malware and cybercriminals. Cyberattacks are attempts to access our devices information that can lead to a loss of money and personal information (Readgov 2022). In our society today Wi-Fi is everywhere and during our daily life we may connect to unprotected free Wi-Fi services multi times a day. Unfortunately, it is a common occurrence to have our financial information stolen and our credit card compromised by fraudulent activities. These days cyber criminals are no longer just targeting large companies but more constantly targeting individuals with ransomware that seeks personal and financial information. They may take smaller amounts of money from credit cards and bank accounts (Readgov 2022). </p>

				<p>Cybersecurity more than ever needs to become everyone's personal responsibility no different to locking your car while inside the shops or home while your away on holiday. The recent increase of data breaches mean that cybersecurity is no longer just important for big business and regulated industries, but now more than ever small business and private citizens are at risk of suffering irrecoverable reputational damage following data breaches (Tunggal, A.T. 2019).</p>

				<h2>Developments in Machine Learning</h2>
				<h3>Machine Learning - What Is It?</h3>
				<p>Machine Learning(ML) is defined as  "the technique that improves system performanceby learning from experience via computational methods," (Zhou, 2021). It literallyenables machines to learn from data and thus acquire knowledge.  This is accomplishedby making "learning algorithms" that can be used to predict outcomes or "models" (Zhou,2021). With the myriad of data now available worldwide, it is imperative that a system isable to collect, manage, analyse, and make sense of all this information and makesound decisions or predictions which can be applied to real world scenarios.</p>
				<p>Data analysis is at the heart of machine learning.  According to Baloglu, Ratifi and Nazha(2022), "when there are a large number of variables, or their relation to the outputvariable is too complex, or non-linear to be described by linear lines, or even when thereis no obvious output variable to be predicted in the dataset,... a different approach isneeded. This alternative strategy is called ML."  What makes ML revolutionary is that thelearning is acquired by establishing rules from enormous amounts of data “andcombining them in nonlinear and highly interactive ways.This capacity allows us to usenew kinds of data, whose sheer volume or complexity would previously have madeanalyzing them unimaginable.”(Obermeyer & Emanuel,2016). It is reminiscent of themovie, The Terminator, albeit in a non-violent context,  wherein the machine storesdifferent outcomes or possibilities based on experience/data input and makes calculateddecisions based on these experiences. With machine learning, though, millions ofvariables are stored and calculated.</p>
				<h3>Machine Learning - Current and Future Applications</h3>
				<p>The applications for this technology are numerous and wide in scope.  For example, datacollected from satellites are used for meteorological, energy and environmentalresearch; from a business perspective, machine learning can be used for sales andinvestment analysis, optimising logistics and operations research (Johra, Verma andPaul, 2020); from a lay person point-of-view, the humble “Google search” function is aproduct of extensive data analysis through machine learning - mapping associations andpatterns generate what we have now regarded as a common search by keyword, or byphoto (Zhou, 2021).  Communications (including speech recognition), softwareengineering; architecture (Johra, Verma and Paul, 2020); and bioinformatics, whichincludes genetics and cancer research, (Baloglu, Ratifi and Nazha, 2022) and roboticsare among the applications of ML.</p>
				<p>Some examples of specific machine learning successes are:<br/>
					<ul>
						<li>In the medical field, machine learning has been successfully applied in the fieldsof ophthalmology and radiology. "For example, in ophthalmology the diagnosis of
						diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, and in radiology the diagnosisof stroke or cancers from digital images is promising." (Baloglu, Ratifi and Nazha,2022).  The digital pixels in radiographs are now bits of data that are analysed asindividual variables resulting in clusters that allow clinicians to learn“contours offracture lines, parenchymal opacities, and more,” (Obermeyer & Emanuel, 2016).ML and Deep Learning (DL)  have also been used in covid-19 detection(Alyasseri, et al, 2021).</li>
						<li>for the common person, we see an increase in the use of "Computer Vision andNatural Language Processing (NLP)"   e.g. facial recognition in  smartphones,Google translate, self-driving cars, conversational AIs such as Alexa, Siri, Google(Zhou,2021; )</li>
						<li>in the justice system, ML plays a big part in the implementation of cybersecurity.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>As exemplified above, the applications Increased automation is a direct effect ofincreased reliance on machine learning.  The medical field, for example,  is expectingto.expand the applications of ML into the subspecialties of paediatrics, (Baloglu, Ratifiand Nazha, 2022).  Machine learning will allow improved prognosis, reduce human errorby allowing the machine to interpret images, and improve diagnostic accuracy(Obenmeyer & Emanuel, 2016).</p>
				<p>In environmental science, ML enables the analysis of non-linear big data such as inecosystem service research (Scowen, et al., 2021);</p>
				<p>In economics, "[the] staggering volumes of digital information relevant to measuring andunderstanding the economy are generated each second by an increasing array ofdevices that monitor transactions and business processes as well as track the activitiesof workers and consumers." This means that the time is ripe for machine learning to beincorporated into economic statistics (Abraham, et al., 2022).</p>
				<p>Automated machine learning and further use of augmented reality are futuristicdevelopments (Hutter, et al., 2019).</p>
				<p>The digitisation of raw data over the years has paved the way for this information to bereadily available for mining and analyses.  We now have a "staggering volume ofinformation",  (Abraham, Jarmin, Moyer, & Shapiro, M. D., 2022). Machine learningwould have been ineffective had it not been for the existence of big data. Hinton's 2006Deep Learning theory paved the way for the idea that machines can learn imagepatterns. Deep neural networks such as the one developed by Meta allowed theprocessing of larger data.</p>
				<h3>Machine Learning - The Impact</h3>
				<p>The surge in ML's popularity across various fields has given rise to the development ofAutomated Machine Learning (autoML). Simply put, it's machine learning without the  orwith limited interference from a human engineer.    An application or software that can beinstalled and be expected to generate predictions with minimal intervention.  Accordingto Hutter, Kotthiff, and Vanschoren (2019), "this is particularly true in the booming field ofdeep learning, where human engineers need to select the right neural architectures,training procedures, regularization methods, and hyperparameters of all of thesecomponents in order to make their networks do what they are supposed to do withsufficient performance."</p>
				<p>However, it should be noted that the increasing complexities of machine learning,particularly deep learning, while fascinating and far-reaching in its application, is stillsusceptible to bias. Zhou (2021) has enumerated the following deficiencies in machinelearning: it requires an extensive amount of data which in itself can be expensive toacquire or in some cases infeasible; if the environment changes, the model may becomeuseless; trained models are “blackboxes”. ML models are so complex that it is notpossible to exactly understand and explain how the ML model produced its output,resulting in bias (Baloglu, Ratifi and Nazha, 2022).</p>
				<p>Therefore, improved validation techniques i.e. neutrosophic logic (Varona, Lizama-Mue,& Suárez, 2021), will become necessary.</p>
				<p>Faster processing and more accurate data analysis will be imminent as scientistsendeavour to develop more efficient algorithms that can minimise or identify biasedoutcomes.</p>
				<p>Review of existing  machine learning literature points to the following industries currentlybenefiting from sophisticated machine learning technology:<br/>
					<ol>
						<li>Medicine and health care</li>
						<li>IT</li>
						<li>Business and finance</li>
						<li>Environmental Science</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>From an end user perspective, machine learning will mostly impact us (i.e. patients,consumers).</p>
				<p>Machine learning will continue to displace human intervention in fields requiring dataanalysis.  Potentially, continued ML developments will replace its human counterparts inspecific jobs such as construction work, medical technologists, factory work, face-to-faceretailing such as banking, shopping and hospitality (as these are replaced by self servekiosks).</p>
				<h3>Machine Learning And Everyday Life - A Personal Reflection</h3>
				<p>As a millenial, the advent of machine learning has been very helpful because in this dayand age there is so much new information that was not there before.  Machine learninghas enabled us to filter out what is necessary and what is unnecessary for eachindividual. For example, as an IT student, my current google results and social mediafeeds are related to what I am studying, which saves a lot of time and effort.</p>
				<p>It also enables me to generate results quickly and at my fingertips. Productivity isincreased. The access to resources has become global and instant.</p>
				<p>Robotics (which is an application of machine learning) is now, in a manner of speaking,child's play as exemplified by the increase in STEM toys even in places such as Kmart.</p>
				<p>Research as we know it has been extended to include machine computation asnecessary rather than optional. Where data gathering was limited to a random sample of30 or so, researchers now have access to billions of raw data. Data mining and deeplearning are occupational realities.  As a student, I need to be knowledgeable in basicdata science to be able to progress in any profession.  It is a new language to beacquired and applied in everyday living.</p>
				<p>The older members of my family are now faced with the reality that computer technologyand artificial intelligence are here to stay.  Adjusting their lifestyle to accommodate thisnew way of doing things is a  learning curve that they are growing into.  Simple examplesare learning to do online banking, use virtual assistants, operate streaming and internetTV, Alexa and Google Home, drive eclectic cars with Autopilot. The list grows as thetechnology progresses.</p>
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>Machine learning has revolutionised the way data is handled. It has enabled the analysisof complex, seemingly unrelated, and huge amounts of information into functional andpredictive outcomes. It is now widely used at both industry-level and consumer-leveloperations. As machine learning continues to develop into a norm, its integration into theday-to-day activities of the common folk will become more apparent, similar to  theevolution of communication which has progressed from snail mail to analog phones tosmartphones.</p>

            <h1>Project Idea</h1>
                <h2>Overview - IC Diary</h2>
				    <p>IC Diary is a one-stop app for monitoring Interstitial Cystitis symptoms and flare-ups with the help of tracking foods, liquids, pain, and medications. In addition, it will give the user an overview of day-to-day wellness.</p>
				<h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p>This project is of interest to one of our members as their wife suffers from Interstitial Cystitis. There are few apps on the app stores to help track flare-ups with certain food groups. According to the Melbourne Bladder Clinic, it is estimated that 8-1600 people per 100,000 are affected (Bladder Pain Syndrome and Interstitial Cystitis, Melbourne Bladder Clinic). Unfortunately, there is no cure for this condition, and only pain management plans to ease the severity of pain and discomfort. With so many different causes of flare-ups and pain, every person's experience will vary. A particular food type could cause severe pain for one and not the other. So this daily log will better help people suffering from this condition monitor the foods and liquids that cause them pain</p> 
                    <p>The diary would help to be able to track what triggers a sufferer and at what times of the month. My wife is a strong supporter of the reminder notification feature as we all know life gets in the way and she has found in the past with other apps she has tried, she may not get back to it for a few days and then has to try and remember what she ate and drank and her pain scale on that day. Which can be difficult as she has suffered from chronic pain for over 6 years now and eventually it all starts to fade into one another.</p> 
                    <p>Currently on the market there is a paid app called ‘mySymptoms food diary’ ($9.99). This app is an all-round app for multiple illnesses (their description list IBS, migraines and eczema as the main ones). FODMAP which is helpful in the respect of the different options of food however that is more dedicated to people with IBS and gut problems. My wife struggles the most in regards to being able to eat something one day and then a few days or weeks later eat the same thing and have a completely different reaction to it.</p> 
                    <p>My wife is currently trying to stay away and limit her intake from acidic foods and drinks such as tomatoes, lemons, pineapple, oranges, coffee, soft drinks, fruit juices, sauces/condiments (tomato sauce, vinegar) & alcohol to name a few. When she does she eats small amounts and then drinks water to flush it out quickly as that can weaken the acidic values and soften the symptoms. However even doing all this doesn’t always help. This is what made her think of this app design with the reminder to enter her daily food and drink and her pain scale so she can look back over the months to see what times are worse as per comment above about eating something one time and then having a different effect on her a couple of days later.</p>
                    
                <h2>Group Motivation</h2>
                    <p>As a team, we decided that we would take the opportunity to develop an app that would help provide a more effortless and better solution to IC suffers daily lives. In addition, we wanted to contribute to a project that would positively impact people. This condition was relatively unknown to our team. After an educational opportunity provided by one of our team members, we decided that the potential this app could offer someone suffering from IC was too good of a chance to pass up. After speaking to Chris, he briefly explained his wife's condition and how difficult it can be to monitor and stay on top of it. So we thought we could spend our time and create this app that would be truly useful for other people daily. With Chris dealing with this condition daily, we could see how motivated he was and how impactful this could be for his wife and other people who suffer from IC. Hopefully, we can create and provide an app that lives to change for thousands of people suffering in silence. We are not motivated by fame or fortune but purely by the change to help improve the quality of someone's daily life.</p>  
                    <p>Furthermore, we needed to tackle a manageable project to our skill levels. As an introduction to the world of Information Technology, the skill set of our group varies. This is our first experience coding HTML and CSS for most of us. Whereas some of us already have some knowledge in these areas. Therefore, having a more manageable project combining software and functions will allow our group to also focus on the quality of work we produce.</p>
                                       
				<h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>The application features will be basic at first. The homepage will be a calendar that will be colour coded using the pain scale colours to see an overview of the month. You can click on each day and go into detail, via a text box, on precisely what food and liquid you had during the day. A medication logs via a text box to log which medication you have taken, like paracetamol, Ibuprofen, or more potent painkillers. You can also add how many times you had to urinate or go to the toilet, as flare-ups can increase dramatically.</p>
                    <p>As previously stated, a pain scale will be colour-coded with 4 colours. Green represents no pain. Yellow will be a little discomfort or pain. Orange will be for manageable pain and discomfort. Finally, red will be for severe pain, causing the use of strong painkillers and stopping you from doing your day-to-day routines. This will be visible via the homepage, so you can see which days of the month you had which colour and click on them to see what may have caused this pain. In addition, there will be a comments section to note what type of pain you had, such as a stabbing pain or pressing discomfort.</p>
                    <p>The application will have a daily log notification to remind you at specific intervals throughout the day to input the required data to help keep track of your condition and get the most out of the application.</p>
                    <p>From the homepage, there will be an add doctor appointments button, so you will be notified when they are upcoming. In addition, you will be able to have an overview of your entire report so your Doctor can see the rundown on how you and your body have been doing with raw data, but this will come in version 2.</p>
                    <p>This application will be free, with no login required and no fees or subscription services.</p>
                    <p>Version 2 will have added features such as setting up an account so you can keep the data across multiple devices. The pain comments section will be updated to have a couple of common descriptions to select from. The medication will have common ones added as well. We will add a substitution list for common ingredients that can cause flare-ups and what you can use instead. </p>
                    <p>We will also aim for future development of Smartwatch compatibility, making it easier for the user to keep track of notifications. The development of a barcode function will be a necessity moving forward. However, it will take some time to develop the needed database first. Having a scan and add function will make our app even more functional for the user. Effiecentally the goal will also be to have the user scan a product and then warnings from previous diary entries populate to inform the user of potentially harmful ingredients. </p>
                    <p>Currently being not much on the market to choose from this will be an easy addition to sufferer’s lives. With having to either find a notebook or carry one around all the time to keep note of your daily intakes this will be that easy app to keep it all in one place and on you. People never leave home without their smart phones so it will always be at the ready to keep note.</p>
                        
				
                    <img src="UIpicture.jpg" alt="UI visualisation"/>
				<h2>Landscape</h2>
					<p>There is a very small pool of apps to choose from for IC sufferers, on the IOS app store there is 4. 2 with 1 star reviews. Both are at a cost to the user with no idea on it if will work or benefit them and their symptoms. The other 2 have no ratings as yet. It seems like the 2 non rated apps at this stage have the most comparable functions to our idea.</p>
					<p>Our project will stand out as we have a person who suffers from the condition giving us the feedback on what will help her with the control and tracking of her day to day life.</p>
				
				<h2>Aims and Goals</h2>
					<p>Our main aim for this project is to have an application that makes the general day to day monitoring for suffers easy. An application that can monitor everything that may seem to unfazed the normal person but can cause crippling pain to an IC sufferer.</p>
					<p>The first aim of our project is to get the home page calendar showing the pain scale colour scheme set up and running. This will give the sufferer the monthly run down and tracker of their pain scale on the good, bad and ugly days. Generally remembering which days were horrible and not when it comes time to doctor’s visit is very hard to keep track of making this a must to start with.</p>
					<p>Second will be the pain type, different foods and liquids can cause different types of pain, such as burning, stabbing, constant and so on. Giving a description to the pain could make the pain treatment different. Some may need heat packs or pads and some could need pain medication.</p>
					<p>Third is the daily notification reminder to input the day’s intake of food and liquid. In our busy lives remembering to open an app to tell it what we drank and ate during the day can easily escape our minds but with the reminders set by yourself you can never forget and keep the tracking up to date and true.</p>
					<p>Fourthly the doctor’s appointment reminders with the time, date, contact information and general notes for the visit. With specialists appointments being months apart it can be very hard to remember exactly when they are and without having to keep a note on the fridge or have it written down somewhere else you can easily input it into the app and have notifications on the appointments.</p>
					<p>The toilet tab will be the next goal and will help with the sufferers remembering of the time of the visit and if any pain had occurred. The notes part could be used if the user would like to specify the type of pain or any abnormalities. </p>
					<p>Lastly we have the medication tab. This is an easy to use log of which medication the user has taken and at what time.</p>
						
				<h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
					<p></p>
				<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                    <p>For this app to be created, I will use JavaScript through the react.js framework as it can be used for IOS, Android and web browsers. It is a very versatile and easy-to-use language that is used by all modern browsers. Moreover, it gives access to an entire JavaScript library.</p>
                    <p>React native will give us access to a collection of special react components. For example, it connects the JavaScript language to specific platforms, like IOS and Android, without having to learn particular languages for those platforms. It can also give us the option to access the native platform API's such as camera, notifications, and GPS tracking.</p>
                    <p>We will use the EXPO CLI to create and ship the app to different platforms. It uses the Reach Native library and helps configure the JavaScript language to be interpreted by IOS and Android devices.</p>
					<p>As we write the code, we can download and see how the app progresses in real-time by using EXPO GO on our devices. We will need to have Node.js downloaded as some packages will be using this to run.</p>
                    <p>For storing all this information, we will require the use of MySQL.</p>
                    <p>There are two main disadvantages to using JavaScript, one being the security side. Since JavaScript code is executed via the client side, it is far easier for bugs and code issues to be used for malicious purposes. Some browsers will interpret the code differently, causing minor detail changes for the end user.</p>
                    

				<h2>Required Skills</h2>
				    <p>To get this project running, we will need to learn how to code in JavaScript and download React.js. We will also need to be able to use a source code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, or Sublime Text. In addition, we will need to be able to use the EXPO CLI and know the correct commands that go with this.</p>
					<p>Lastly, we will need to know how to configure the unique components of the React Native Library. Once we have all the technical side of the building of this app, we will then require a marketing team to get this app out in the world and on people's minds and in their faces to showcase what this app could bring to their lives.</p>
	
				<h2>Roles</h2>
					<p>Andrew took on the role of UI designer by using AdobeXD to create an interactive prototype of the app showcasing the screens and buttons.</p>
					<p>Troy and Chris were in the research roles for the information needed on what to track and look for with this condition.</p>
					<p>Sasha was our document designer and video editor for the marketing side.</p>
					<p>Fawaz was the Production manager with setting out the scopes, limits and our timetable for the entire project.</p>
				<h2>Testing</h2>
                    <p>For the first testing stages we will ask Chris’ wife to give it a test for about a month to get a full report back on it. Once we have her feedback we will try to find some healthcare clinics or the government health sector to fund us a test phase to get it out to more sufferers of IC.</p>
                <h2>Timeframe</h2>
					<p></p>
				<h2>Risks</h2>
                    <p>The biggest risk we will have with this project is the lack of programming ability. As an introduction to IT is all we have we will need to either outsource the programming sections or dive head first into the coding side and learn ourselves very quickly. </p>
					<p>The other risk will be lack of testers. With very little known about IC and being very hard to diagnose we may struggle to find people with this disease to properly test it. That is why I feel contacting the Governments health sectors to team up with will work well for this project to get a wider scope to get testers.</p>
                <h2>Group Processes and Communications</h2>
                    <p>Our groups meetings will take place twice a week. Wednesdays at 6:30pm AEDST and Saturday morning at 9:30am AEDST. This will be done via Microsoft Teams program which we will have a group chat to keep up to date with how our progress is tracking. If we haven’t heard from a member of the team for at least one week we will unfortunately need to divide their work up amongst the attending people to get on with the project so it doesn’t fall behind our schedule.</p>
                <h2>Outcomes</h2>
				    <p>If this project were successful, we would have an application that Interstitial Cystitis and Painful Bladder Syndrome sufferers can use and interact with to better understand how their body works, what foods and liquids, and at certain times of the month. They will be able to have all this information in one easy to go to app. This will benefit sufferers greatly in keeping on top of which foods to steer clear of.</p>
					<p>I believe once we have this app up and running and have tweaked all the bugs and issues, we can take this format and make it useful for other body issues requiring constant monitoring and upkeep.</p>

        <section id="reflect">
            <h1>Group reflection</h1>
            <span class="fullgroup">
				<p>Our team was extremely organized, and communication was always very good. The group’s workload was never allocated. Every member in the group was always willing to nominate themselves for tasks rather than someone else. There was never a task that was forgotten or remained unallocated. Consequently, we were always prepared for every meeting and were ready to submit for the original assignment due date.  For the groups meetings the chairperson was always rotated to share the workload. We started our communication on the canvas discussion board but quickly transitioned to Microsoft Teams. Teams took a little bit to get used to but was eventually extremely efficient. All messages were sent via a created group chat and all meetings were preorganized and recorded in Teams.</p> 
				<p>Honestly our group was very happy with all aspects of this group project. The only form of improvement would have come if we had started our meetings and projects a couple of weeks earlier. However, this was more difficult to achieve because of the Christmas period.</p>
				<p>Generally, in a group project there are people who do not get along. It was surprising how our group worked so well together. We had never met each other prior, and the group was formed randomly. We were apprehensive and worried about how the group dynamics would be formed. There were no big personalities, egos or overbearing people who tried to dominate the group. Group discussions flowed extremely well, and no one ever spoke over one another. There was never a disagreement and everyone in the group was willing to go above and beyond to help the group and improve our work. We were all pleasantly surprised at how well the group blended so naturally and easily. </p>
				<p>Everyone was beginning their studies coming from different non dominate IT industries. We were all nervous and inexperienced to begin. Not one of us was experienced in one particular area however everyone was always willing to offer advice and provide any support whenever necessary. We are all happy to continue with this group project and excited to move forward working alongside one another.</p>
			</span>
			<span class="teammember">
				<h2>Troy</h2>
				<p>Our group worked extremely well together. Everyone in the group was very motivated to contribute to the team. It was refreshing to have everyone participate in all our meetings. All members were always on time and the work was split evenly throughout the project. I thought the only thing that could have been improved was the interview. The interview was still very good, but we could have put a little more time into planning who was going to speak and limit the quiet times that were present. All our team members were willing to put their hands up and use their personal strengths to help the team out. It was amazing that we never had anything that wasn’t done or left not being done. It was good that no task ever needed to be designate to group members, instead we all volunteered quickly to get everything done. The fact we were all organized and wanting to have the work finished earlier rather than later was a credit to everyone.</p>
			</span>
			<span class="teammember">
				<h2>Andrew</h2>
				<p>When our group was first formed and before being able to greet everybody in a meeting, I was definitely nervous about the aspect of working in a group and meeting new people. I was intrigued about what the structure of our group would look like, if there were any big personalities or reserved characters. After the first meeting, which I unfortunately missed, I had the opportunity to look at everyone’s profiles that we completed for assignment one. The initial overall perception I had of my new group members was certainly positive. The first area of each profile that caught my attention were the personality tests and understanding reports. It was refreshing to see the makeup of our group was a healthy balance of various personas which helped settle my nerves about meeting my new teammates. If I could go back, I would post my profile directly to the canvas discussion board where we first created our groups. This way my team members could have the opportunity to get an idea for my own persona and traits as well as understand a bit about my background which could serve as a bit of an icebreaker.</p>
			</span>
			<span class="teammember">
				<h2>Sasha</h2>
				<p>When I first heard there would be group work I was quite anxious, when I learned that we would be required to do video chats, even more so. However, in practice our group has been a pleasure to work with and none of my fears proved true. The initial formation of the group was a little slow, mainly due to the christmas period adding to communication delays. I believe that it would have been a benefit if the class were explicitly instructed to get MS Teams set up when the inital round of grouping prompts occured in tutes. While the assessment was available from the very beginning of the course, I, and no doubt many others, didn't look at it in detail until the first assessment was submitted. I agree with Andrew that it would be a benefit to group formation if we were able to share our assignment 1 projects earlier, whilst also understanding the importance of independent work.</p>
				<p>Overall I am very proud of this group, we have worked well together and knocked the work over reliably and without needing to be pushed by any more than our own personal desires to not let the other group members down. Our group has been effective, kind and supportive throughout.</p>
			</span>
			<span class="teammember">
				<h2>Fawaz</h2>
				<p>I believe this group has done really well with the assignment given.</p>
				<p>In the beginning most of us were getting used to Teams and were a bit confused and nervous but when we started our first meeting we all got along quickly.</p>
				<p>Throughout the weeks the structure and schedule was clear. We all followed it without problems and when there was an issue, we would report it on Teams and give an update on what’s going on with the project.</p>
				<p>We all helped each other willingly and as the youngest member of the group, they really supported me and encouraged me, especially when it was my turn to chair the meeting.</p>
				<p>None of us were negative or had a grudge on each other at all. We all coordinated with each other and got to finish our parts on time.</p>
				<p>One thing we could have used in the future is the calendar in the Meetings, just to see everything there, the meetings, tasks due dates and any absence.</p>
				<p>Other than that, I am really appreciative to be in this group and I believe we all did a really good job in this project.</p>

			</span>
			<span class="teammember">
				<h2>Chris</h2>
				<p>I believe our group’s dynamic compliments each person. We have been keeping up to date with our MS Teams communication and sharing the workload around this assignment. Our meetings have been attended by everyone and everyone has had their input on certain parts of the assignment.</p> 
				<p>The surprising thing I have found is that with the age range of this group we are all as interested in this field and helping each other without any hesitation. From the essay writing to helping with feedback and researching the condition that this project will relate to has been a big eye opener for me. In my current profession I see many people who don’t have the drive or respect in their work ethics and just go to work to get a pay cheque and act as if no one is at home. Seeing the group get around the work load and take it on board and complete it with such professionalism and inclusion has been very refreshing for me.</p>
